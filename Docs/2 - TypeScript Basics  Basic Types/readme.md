## Core Types
![](../img/7.png)

let's see how typescript can help during development
```ts
function add(num1:number,num2:number){
    return num1+num2;
}

const number1 = 12;
const number2 = 56;

const result = add(number1,number2);
console.log(result);

```
here is we pass a 'string' or boolean we will get an error during the development.
this will give us time to fix the code during development.
